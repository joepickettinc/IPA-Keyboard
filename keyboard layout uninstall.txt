I would remove this layout from the active layout set (if it is not done yet: Regional and
Language Options -- Language tab -- Details... button), then run Regedit, navigate to:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layouts]

and find the text, that you see as the name of this layout (say, it is: Corrected US). The
key in the left pane will be then:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layouts\000XXXXX]

(where XXXXX are the digits) with the values in the right pane something like:

"Layout Display Name"="Corrected US"
"Layout File"="kbdCorrected.dll"
"Layout Id"="00XX"
"Layout Text"="Corrected US"

Then find and delete the file mentioned here as Layout File (kbdCorrected.dll in this
example) first in \windows\system32\dllcache folder, then in \windows\system32 folder.

Then navigate to

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout\DosKeybCodes]

in the left pane of Regedit, and find the value "000XXXXX"="xx" in the right pane
(000XXXXX is the same number as above; substitute xx with the language code of this
layout). Delete this line: right click 000XXXXX, and select: Delete.

Then navigate in the left pane to
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layouts\000XXXXX]
again, and delete this (i.e. 000XXXXX) key.
